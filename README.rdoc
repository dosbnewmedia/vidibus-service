Description goes here.


== Requirements

In order to work properly this gem needs the route /connector to call a Rack app. Usually this route gets provided automatically but that may fail if your application has some sort of catch-all route. To check if the route works as expected, just call http://yourapp.com/connector and expect an error message like +This service has not been configured yet. Use your Connector to set it up.+

If you don't see this error message, add the route manually at the top of your routes.rb:

  match "/connector" => Vidibus::Service::ConnectorApp


== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
